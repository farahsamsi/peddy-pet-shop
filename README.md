# Peddy - Pet Adoption  üêæ

Peddy is a modern, responsive web platform designed to help users browse and adopt pets easily. Using real-time data from provided APIs, users can explore pet categories, view detailed pet profiles, sort by price, and even like or adopt their favorite pets.


## Features

- Browse and filter pets by dynamic categories such as dogs, cats, and more. The platform fetches data from an API to display the pets dynamically.
- Sort the pets in descending order of price for easy browsing. The sorting can also be applied to pets within a selected category.
- Users can click on a "Details" button for each pet, which opens a modal showing pet information such as breed, birth date, gender, vaccination history, and more.
- The platform is fully responsive across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) thanks to Tailwind CSS breakpoints.


## ‚öôÔ∏è ES6 Features Used

This project is built using modern ES6 features, making the code more readable and efficient. Some of the key ES6 features include:

- Async/Await: Used to fetch data from the API asynchronously.

- Arrow Functions: Simplified function expressions to make the code more concise and readable.

- Template Literals: Used for dynamic HTML generation within JavaScript, especially for rendering pet cards and modal content.

- Destructuring: Extracting values from objects and arrays to make the code more readable when dealing with API data.
